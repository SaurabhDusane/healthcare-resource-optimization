> An end-to-end data analytics platform combining web scraping, statistical analysis, machine learning, and interactive dashboards to optimize healthcare resource allocation and predict emergency room demand patterns.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project demonstrates advanced data analytics capabilities by analyzing 100,000+ emergency room visit records while incorporating real-time web-scraped data from healthcare news, social media, and public health sources. The system provides early warning signals for demand surges and actionable insights for hospital administrators.

### 🎯 Key Features

- **Automated Web Scraping Pipeline**: Collects real-time data from CDC, Reddit, and Twitter
- **Comprehensive Statistical Analysis**: Hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, effect size calculations
- **Predictive Modeling**: Time series forecasting (91% accuracy) and acuity classification (87% accuracy)
- **Sentiment Analysis**: NLP processing of 25,000+ social media posts
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Tableau-based visualization with early warning system
- **Production-Ready Code**: Modular architecture, error handling, comprehensive testing

### 💡 Business Impact

- ✅ **3-5 day advance warning** for ER demand spikes via social media signals
- ✅ **12% model improvement** when incorporating web-scraped features
- ✅ **40% higher visits** identified for Monday 6-9 PM (staffing optimization)
- ✅ **2.3x higher non-urgent visits** among uninsured patients (preventive care targeting)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

**Programming & Libraries:**
- Python 3.9+ (pandas, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn)
- Web Scraping (BeautifulSoup, Selenium, PRAW, snscrape)
- Machine Learning (Prophet, XGBoost, ARIMA)
- NLP (TextBlob, spaCy)

**Tools & Platforms:**
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Tableau Public / Power BI
- Git & GitHub
- VS Code

```

### Usage

**Run Web Scrapers:**
```bash
# Individual scrapers
python src/scrapers/cdc_scraper.py
python src/scrapers/reddit_scraper.py
python src/scrapers/twitter_scraper.py

# Automated daily scraping
python src/scrapers/scheduler.py
```

**Execute Analysis:**
```bash
jupyter notebook
# Open notebooks/ and run in sequence (01-09)
```

**Generate Dashboard Data:**
```bash
python src/data_processing/dashboard_prep.py
# Output files in data/processed/ ready for Tableau
```

## 📈 Key Results

### Predictive Performance
- **ER Visit Forecasting**: 91.3% accuracy (MAPE: 8.7%)
- **Acuity Classification**: 87.2% accuracy (ROC-AUC: 0.91)
- **Feature Importance**: News mentions (lag 3) ranked #2 predictor

### Data Collected
- 📰 **5,247 CDC/WHO news articles** scraped and analyzed
- 💬 **12,381 Reddit health discussions** with sentiment analysis
- 🐦 **18,756 health-related tweets** processed
- 🏥 **106,234 ER visit records** from NHAMCS dataset

### Statistical Findings
- Monday 6-9 PM shows **40.3% higher** ER visits (p < 0.001)
- News outbreak mentions precede ER spikes by **3.2 days** (Granger causality test)
- Uninsured patients have **2.31x higher** non-urgent visit rates (χ² test, p < 0.001)
- Social media sentiment correlates with visit acuity (ρ = 0.43, p < 0.01)
